Use these commands to be add files and such to a repository!

1) git add --all
    --This adds all the files in the current repository

2) git commit -m "<Insert comment Here>"
    --This commits the file to be uploaded.
    --Be sure to use a description, yet brief comment about the changes
    
3) git push origin master
    --This pushes all the changes to the central repository
    ---If we had more collaborators, we'd use branches, but not necessary with just 2 peeps
    
Just remember, it's ALWAYS THIS ORDER:
Add --> Commit --> Push

Note:

You can have more than one commits before pushing.
